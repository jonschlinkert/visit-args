# visit-args [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/visit-args.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/visit-args)

> Visit application methods that map directly to command line arguments and emit events for flags.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i visit-args --save
```

## Usage

First, an example, so the following docs make sense.

```js
var argv = require('minimist');
var cli = require('visit-args');

// see the `app` example in `./examples/app.js` for details
var App = require('./examples/app');
var app = new App();

cli.on('set', function (key, val) {
  // do stuff with key/val 
});

cli.on('get', function (key, val) {
  // do stuff with key/val
});

cli.visit(app, argv(['--set=a', '--get=a']));
```

**How this works**

The idea is that `app` is an object with methods on it, and when a command line flag matches the name of a method on `app`, that method is called and is passed any additional arguments related to that method call (that's the _tricky part_: "additional arguments". Which is what this lib does - figure out how to invoke that method with the right arguments...)

**Method arguments**

This brings up the question: "What is passed to the method when it's called, if all we have is a command line flag?". That's a good question. This is easiest to explain by way of examples. Let's say you pass the following flag:

```sh
$ --a=b
```

Minimist would parse this to `{a: 'b'}`. Next, if you're application happens to have a method named `a`, then `visit-args` would invoke the method and pass `b` to it. A more meaningful example might be something like:

```sh
$ --del=foo
```

Which would invoke the `del` method on app, with the `foo` argument. In other words:

```js
app.del('foo');
```

If, more often than not, your methods need more information than just a string or boolean to be able to take any kind of meaningful action, then it's worth considering using a library like [expand-args](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/expand-args), which will post-process arguments after minimist, but before visit-args, so that the following is possible:

```sh
$ --set=a:b
```

Which would invoke the following on `app`:

```js
app.set('a', 'b');
```
